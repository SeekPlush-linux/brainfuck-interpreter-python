# Brainfuck Interpreter
An interpreter for the obscure programming language Brainfuck, written in Python

I made this interpreter out of complete boredom and sort of as a challenge for myself lol\
And I've put it on GitHub because why not :3

## Installation
1. Clone this repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SeekPlush-linux/brainfuck-interpreter-python
   ```
3. And that's all!

## Usage
There are two ways to use the interpreter:
1. Simply launch the script `brainfuck-interpreter-python.py` and input your brainfuck code, or...
2. In a terminal, launch the script with your brainfuck code in quotes after it:
   ```sh
   python brainfuck-interpreter-python.py "some brainfuck code here..."
   ```
